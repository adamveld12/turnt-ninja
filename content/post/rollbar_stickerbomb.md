I've been enjoying my convertible this summer, so needless to say I've got a pretty bad case of miata fever. <!--more-->With that said, I occasionally lurk craigslist for goodies, and I happened to score a rollbar from Jeff, the miata dude I met a few months ago! A few text messages and about $200 later I have a slightly used rollbar in my possession. 

Now this thing is cool, don't get me wrong, but its black and all around pretty meh. After falling in love with the [sticker bomb stance](http://www.buscatuning.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/sticker-bombing-8.jpg) thing going on, and how cheap it seems to be to get a good look, I bought some sticker vinyl sheets on Amazon and went to work. The end result below:

I'm not sure when I'm going to install this thing. I was warned by Jeff that its a pain in the ass, so I'm not looking forward to it. I'm going to have to pick up a few more tools since it requires drilling into the body for the mounting bolts. I plan on posting about the process with plenty of step by step pictures and commentary in the coming months.
