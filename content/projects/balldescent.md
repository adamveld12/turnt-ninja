Ball Descent is a 3D, top down platform game made in Unreal Development Kit for a school project. <!--more-->Ball Descent was made by Adam Veldhousen, Eric Freeman, and Joshua Klein.

The game features:

 * Physics based gameplay
 * Cutscenes
 * 4 Levels
 * Original music composed by [Eric Freeman](http://www.giantshaft.com)
 * No UI design - The ball's color is your health


We used pretty much every feature of UDK. All Unrealscript was written by Josh and myself, and the music, scaleform menus, and game design/playability were contributions from Eric. This project spanned about 5 weeks time, and ended with a playable game that we demoed at Neumont's Project Showcase.
