Arcade is a Scaleform tech demo that demonstrates how to integrate flash mini games into an Unreal Engine game.<!--more--> The 3D artwork (Arcade Machine and TV) were done by me in 3DS Max 2012 and I skinned them using Photoshop CS3. The flash games and music were made by Eric Freeman in Flash Studio and I whipped up a bit on UnrealScript and kismet magic to send keyboard and mouse inputs to them. 

Features:

  * Complete Arcade Machines with flash games
  * Tv Screens that show flash movies
  * Music by [Eric Freeman](http://www.giantshaft.com)
