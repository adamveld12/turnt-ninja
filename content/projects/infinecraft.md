Infinecraft is a 3D procedurally generated platform puzzle game made in XNA 3.1 in C# for a school project. Built by Adam Veldhousen, Eric Freeman, Barry Nix and Jefferson Wagner, this was our first attempt at a 3D game and we completed it in just 5 weeks time. Barry implemented the physics and collision detection components, Jefferson worked on the perlin/simplex noise, ridged multifractal and level construction tools, Eric made custom music, game design and player movement, and I dealt with the graphics and rendering pipeline.

Features:
  
  * Fully procerurally generated levels
  * Hand made levels
  * Water effects
  * Particle effects
