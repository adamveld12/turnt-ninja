A few friends of mine mentioned [One Game A Month](http://www.onegameamonth.com) and I saw it as a perfect opportunity to pick up a couple of projects to help hone some of my newly acquired skills in [Go](http://golang.org) and [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/).<!--more--> I sat down and banged out a list of objectives for my 1GAM, and I'm going to try to incorporate the following techniques in some of them. Every game doesn't have to have all or any of these, they're just some things I hope to have under my belt by the end of the year:

## Objectives
  * Procedural Generation: Levels, or otherwise
  * [Entity Component System](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html)
  * [Audio/Rhythm gameplay](http://runhello.com/p/396)
  * Sandbox
  * Retro/line art
  * HTML 5 Games, maybe a little [three.js](http://threejs.org/) or [playcanvas](http://playcanvas.com)

Here are my game ideas for the first few months, I'll update this as time goes on.

## Game Ideas
&nbsp;
### January
 An HTML5 browser game. The idea here is to learn some simple concepts for building multiplayer games.

  * Multiplayer: Use socket.io to implement multiplayer
  * Start with something dumb, like tic tac toe and work from there, or a MUD
 
### February
  A music based game where you're a boat riding a wave that moves to a song. Maybe use [playcanvas](http://playcanvas.com)


### To Be Continued...
