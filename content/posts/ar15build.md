I've been wanting to get into firearms for a while now. With college, work obligations and life in general standing in the way you tend to put things like starting new hobbies on hold. <!--more-->After throwing up my hands and getting my shit together, I started researching and settled on the trusty AR-15 as my first gun. Since one of the main strengths of ARs are the availability of parts (some even say they're adult legos) I figured I'd take on the challenge of building my own.

I knew that I wanted a midrange build that could end up being a decent multi purpose rifle.
